## Per-detector results

| Detector | Execution | Inspected files | Complete | Partial | Not analyzed | Diagnostics | Coverage |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `ohscanner.cpp.bounds` | completed | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | complete |

## Candidate evidence and missing proof

| Detector | Candidate ID | File:line | Rule | Unverified proof obligations |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| — | — | — | — | No reported candidate; NOT proof of safety |

## Coverage gaps

Scope counts source inspection, not complete semantic coverage; partial remains unknown.
Files without a claiming detector: 0
- `ohscanner.cpp.bounds`: complete, 1/1 applicable files examined; unexamined=0

## Limitations

- Diagnostics are candidates/evidence only, not proof of security impact.
- Zero diagnostics does NOT mean the component is free of vulnerabilities.
- Git origin name is user declared; source is pinned local objects, not an OH product build.
- No compilation flags/macros, symbolic execution, hard plugin timeout or runtime validation.
- `ohscanner.cpp.bounds`: Absence of a finding is not a safe verdict; partial/failed source is unknown, not a miss.
- `ohscanner.cpp.bounds`: Candidate only: lexical array/copy facts do not prove exploitability or a product vulnerability.
- `ohscanner.cpp.bounds`: Pointer capacities, aliases, wrappers, interprocedural lengths, macros, template instantiation and full C++ CFG semantics remain unknown unless explicitly modeled.
- `ohscanner.cpp.bounds`: M1 local Git objects pinned by full commit/tree; repository ownership is user-declared.
- `ohscanner.cpp.bounds`: Execution is synchronous; hard timeout/memory isolation is not yet implemented.
- `ohscanner.cpp.bounds`: Diagnostic does not establish vulnerability, reachability or security impact.

## Frozen execution plan

- Planner: 0.1.1; mode: explicit
- Plan SHA-256: `36d427e6621cd17a2e93b66982d6729b5832f11409dda65f15c6dc24984cf409`
- Language matching plans attempts; actual coverage remains in the results above.
