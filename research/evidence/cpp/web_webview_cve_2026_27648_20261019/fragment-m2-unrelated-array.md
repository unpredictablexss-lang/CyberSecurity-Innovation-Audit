## Per-detector results

| Detector | Execution | Inspected files | Complete | Partial | Not analyzed | Diagnostics | Coverage |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `ohscanner.cpp.bounds` | completed | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | complete |

## Candidate evidence and missing proof

| Detector | Candidate ID | File:line | Rule | Unverified proof obligations |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ohscanner.cpp.bounds` | `ohscanner.cpp.bounds:87f6abc26828e05c` | `unrelated_array.cpp:1` | `ohcpp-memory-bounds-index-candidate-002` | capacity_and_alias_identity=unknown; guard_dominance=unknown; cross_function_and_macro_context=missing; entry_or_privilege_boundary=missing; attacker_control=missing; trigger_conditions=missing; cia_impact=missing |

## Coverage gaps

Scope counts source inspection, not complete semantic coverage; partial remains unknown.
Files without a claiming detector: 0
- `ohscanner.cpp.bounds`: complete, 1/1 applicable files examined; unexamined=0

## Limitations

- Diagnostics are candidates/evidence only, not proof of security impact.
- Zero diagnostics does NOT mean the component is free of vulnerabilities.
- Git origin name is user declared; source is pinned local objects, not an OH product build.
- No compilation flags/macros, symbolic execution, hard plugin timeout or runtime validation.
- `ohscanner.cpp.bounds`: Absence of a finding is not a safe verdict; partial/failed source is unknown, not a miss.
- `ohscanner.cpp.bounds`: Candidate only: lexical array/copy facts do not prove exploitability or a product vulnerability.
- `ohscanner.cpp.bounds`: Only direct one-hop copy wrappers are summarized; deeper wrappers, function pointers, aliases, macros, templates and full C++ CFG semantics remain unknown.
- `ohscanner.cpp.bounds`: M1 local Git objects pinned by full commit/tree; repository ownership is user-declared.
- `ohscanner.cpp.bounds`: Execution is synchronous; hard timeout/memory isolation is not yet implemented.
- `ohscanner.cpp.bounds`: Diagnostic does not establish vulnerability, reachability or security impact.

## Frozen execution plan

- Planner: 0.1.1; mode: explicit
- Plan SHA-256: `64cbd7815f7d88a479588ec629fed0d4f06488255870ec6eda348506405aae6a`
- Language matching plans attempts; actual coverage remains in the results above.
